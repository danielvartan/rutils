`gutils` is an R package to store and to organize utility functions created by the GIPSO developer team.

Please note that some utility functions are not documented. Access the source code to see them all.

See also other utility or extension packages created by the GIPSO developer team:

* [`encryptrpak`](https://github.com/gipso/encryptrpak): an R package to encrypt/decrypt files of R packages.
* [`lubritime`](https://github.com/gipso/lubritime): an extension for the [lubridate](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate) package to deal with time in R.

## Installation

`gutils` will be always at the [experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) stage of development. We don't intend to publish this package to CRAN.

You can install `gutils` from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/gutils")
```

## Citation

If you use `gutils` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `gutils` citation below.

```{r}
citation("gutils")
```
