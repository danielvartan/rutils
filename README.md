## Overview

`rutils` is an R package that I (Daniel Vartanian) use to store and
organize my utility functions until they are ready to be moved to their
own package.

This package is primarily intended for personal use, but you are welcome
to use it if you find it helpful. If you appreciate the project,
consider giving it a star! (⭐)

Please note that not all functions are exported or documented. Access
the source code to see them all.

## Installation

You can install `rutils` using the
[`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("danielvartan/rutils")
```
